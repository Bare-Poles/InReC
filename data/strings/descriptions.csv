InReC_drover,SHIP,Drover but greg,,,,
InReC_champion,SHIP,Champion but oops smalls!,,,,
InReC_flash_drone,SHIP,"A cheap and disposable interceptor drone, able to swarm and overwhelm most hostile fighter wings with a volley of Flash Bolter fire. Organised resistance proves to be a significant threat though, as they will rapidly fail under any amount of focused point-defense fire.",,,,
InReC_grinder_drone,SHIP,A basic drone platform mounting a Millstone cannon. While somewhat underwhelming in firepower it provides a cheap and consistent source of fire support.,,,,
InReC_flock_drone,SHIP,A basic drone platform mounting a Flock MRM. Contributes effectively to an overall strategem of missile saturation.,,,,

InReC_pulse,WEAPON,"A standard burst fire energy bolt weapon, mostly unremarkable but with the saving grace of an efficient flux profile.",,,,
InReC_pulse_hvy,WEAPON,"A heavier mount of a rather standard burst fire energy bolt weapon, mostly unremarkable but with the saving grace of an efficient flux profile.",,,,
InReC_flash_lt,WEAPON,Fires a burst of volatile energy bolts that scatter over a wide area.,,,,
InReC_flash,WEAPON,Fires a large burst of volatile energy bolts that scatter and saturate a wide area.,,,,
InReC_spark,WEAPON,"Burst fire missile defense weapon, with highly respectable range and projectile velocity.",,,,
InReC_spark_hvy,WEAPON,"An upsized burst fire missile defense weapon, a rapid cycle rate compensates for the somehat anemic low density energy bolts it fires.",,,,
InReC_fusion,WEAPON,Projects a ragged spread of high temprature energy bolts that are highly effective at wearing down armour.,,,,
InReC_gluon,WEAPON,"Fires a large burst of swarming energy bolts, offering somewhat inaccurate long range fire support at a flux premium.",,,,
InReC_disruption,WEAPON,A medium range ion weapon that delivers a temporary buildup of arcing disruptive energy that proves highly effective at disabling enemy systems and engines.,,,,
InReC_negatron,WEAPON,Delivers bursts of highly destructive charged energy bolts. While somewhat flux hungry it performs quite effectively against both shields and armour.,,,,
,,,,,,
InReC_bludgeon,WEAPON,"Fires heavyweight explosive shells that tear through armoured targets, also features an internal magazine allowing for short bursts of rapid fire.",,,,
InReC_millstone,WEAPON,"A simple and reliable two barreled cannon. While the mid-caliber fragmentation shells are somewhat lacking in damage output, the weapon has an easily manageable flux profile.",,,,
InReC_millstone_tri,WEAPON,"A simple and reliable three barreled cannon. While the mid-caliber fragmentation shells are somewhat lacking in damage output, the weapon has an easily manageable flux profile.",,,,
InReC_fusor,WEAPON,"Two light railguns fused into a single weapons system, efficient and consistent, but surpassed in raw firepower by various other weapons.",,,,
InReC_fusor_linked,WEAPON,"A pair of fused railguns, just like the smaller model remains efficient, but retains the comparative lack of damage output.",,,,
InReC_canister,WEAPON,"A snub barreled cannon that fires canisters of high-density flechettes, able to overwhelm shield projectors in an instant, but has a rather short effective range.",,,,
,,,,,,
InReC_flock,WEAPON,A basic lightweight missile. While lacking in speed and payload it has a respectable long-burn engine and integrates an autoloader allowing for sustained support fire.,,,,
InReC_flock_pod,WEAPON,A pod of basic lightweight missiles. While lacking in speed and payload it has a respectable long-burn engine and integrates an autoloader allowing for sustained support fire.,,,,
InReC_pesticide,WEAPON,"A launcher for cheap lightweight missiles, while lacking in payload the presence of an autoloader system means that they can be adequate at suppressing point defense if nothing else.",,,,
InReC_pesticide_pod,WEAPON,"A twin tube launcher for cheap lightweight missiles, while lacking in payload the presence of an autoloader system means that they can be adequate at suppressing point defense if nothing else.",,,,
InReC_fumigator,WEAPON,An armoured missile that is unusual in that rather than directly dealing damage it saturates hostile point defenses by launching a massed volume of flares.,,,,
InReC_defoliant,WEAPON,"An armoured chassis propelled by a powerful single-stage solid fuel engine. While the engine gives it the velocity to deal significant damage to shielding, maneuverability unfortunately suffers in exchange.",,,,
InReC_heart-throb,WEAPON,"A launch rail system for lightweight drones. While the drones are very fragile and rather lightly armed, they can pose a suprisingly significant threat to targets that lack adequate point defense.",,,,
InReC_beekeeper,WEAPON,A Blister micromissile carrier that deploys a barrage of munitions on nearing its target. This blisters submunitions are loaded with a kinetic payload making it effective against shielding but lackluster otherwise.,,,,
InReC_beekeeper_pod,WEAPON,A pod of Blister micromissile carriers that each deploy a barrage of munitions on nearing their target. These blisters submunitions are loaded with a kinetic payload making them effective against shielding but lackluster otherwise.,,,,
InReC_apiarist,WEAPON,A Blister micromissile carrier that deploys a barrage of munitions on nearing its target. This blisters submunitions are loaded with a light shaped charge payload allowing them to tear through large volumes of armour with ease.,,,,
InReC_apiarist_pod,WEAPON,A pod of Blister micromissile carriers that each deploy a barrage of munitions on nearing their target. These blisters submunitions are loaded with a light shaped charge payload allowing them to tear through large volumes of armour with ease.,,,,
InReC_herbicide,WEAPON,"A short range high velocity missile launcher, designed to tear through armoured targets through a massed volume of fire.",,,,
,,,,,,
InReC_flash_lt_drn,WEAPON,Fires a burst of volatile energy bolts that scatter over a wide area. This fighter mounted variant has a longer reload time.,,,,
InReC_millstone_drn,WEAPON,"A simple and reliable cannon. While the mid-caliber fragmentation shells are somewhat lacking in damage output, it has respectable range for a fighter mounted weapon.",,,,
InReC_flock_drn,WEAPON,A basic lightweight missile. While lacking in speed and payload it has a respectable long-burn engine and integrates an autoloader allowing for sustained support fire.,,,,

InReC_cluster_flak,SHIP_SYSTEM,Fires a large number of flak canisters with variable-timed proximity fuses all around the ship.,Defensive,Fires a large number of flak canisters with variable-timed proximity fuses all around the ship. Each canister deals 120 Fragmentation in an area and is targeted to avoid friendly fire.,120 Fragmentation,
InReC_jets,SHIP_SYSTEM,Engages extra thrusters to improve the ship's maneuverability. Also provides a moderate boost to the ship's top speed.,Movement,Provides a brief boost to maneuverability and top speed.,,
InReC_damper,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Briefly activates an energy field  and a pulse generator, that mitigates incoming damage and repels nearby missiles at the cost of disabling weapons and shields.",Defensive,"Briefly activates an energy field  and a pulse generator, that mitigates incoming damage and repels nearby missiles at the cost of disabling weapons and shields.",,
InReC_greg,SHIP_SYSTEM,Deploys an independent Footman attack drone that will autonomously engage hostile targets.,Drone,Deploys an independent Footman attack drone that will autonomously engage hostile targets.,,
