InReC_brawler,SHIP,"Downgrading the flux core that makes the Brawler so potent might seem like a strange choice, but the volume of missile firepower that can be deployed by this modified variant more than makes up for the loss of direct fire capability.",,,,
InReC_vigilance,SHIP,"Outfitting the Vigilance has often been seen as something of an awkward proposition, but this InReCo conversion aims to resolve that issue. Improved defenses and a cluster flak array mean that weapons can be dedicated solely to offense without running into concerns with how the craft can deal with missiles and fighters.",,,,
InReC_centurion,SHIP,"The Centurion is a dependable frigate that is able to survive far more punishemnt than most other ships of its size and this InReCo conversion seeks to go beyond that. An upgraded flux core and superior weapon mounts mean that this ship can not only take damage, but dish it out as well.",,,,
InReC_cerberus,SHIP,"An extensive refit of the Cerberus, a large portion of the storage space has been replaced with an autoforge and the attendant launch mechanisms that allow deployment of Footman drones. While no-longer able to offer any real logistical support this ship is now able to act as an effective drone support platform for smaller fleets.",,,,
InReC_sunder,SHIP,"This InReCo conversion is a textboox example of their doctrine, while it retains a largely energy focused armament. The addition of a significant amount of missile firepower alongside the single ballistic mount shifts the nature of the immediate threat posed by the ship, but it remains largely unchanged in overall role, remaining something of a glass cannon.",,,,
InReC_enforcer,SHIP,"Highly modified from the standard Enforcer hull, this ship can field a dizzying array of missiles, and when combined with a generous cluster flak array it can prove a solid anchor for smaller fleets. While in larger engagements it can act as a dependable and survivable support and escort craft.",,,,
InReC_drover,SHIP,"InReCo converted this Drover to be able to be more capable as a front line combatant, improved defenses and flux systems mean that it can survive better than the standard Drover. Despite the upgrades this ship still remains inferior to a dedicated combat craft, and relies  more on the strategic advantage that it can offer with a mix of missiles, fighters and a Footman drone.",,,,
InReC_champion,SHIP,"Only recently being pushed into production this conversion suprised many in how quickly it was developed by InReCo. The external weapons configuration has seen some notable changes, though internal modifications are suprisingly minor and nearly all of the core hulll framework remains untouched.",,,,
InReC_venture,SHIP,"Converted to act as a carrier, this Venture modification is far more combat capable than the original craft, but some armour and a significant portion of the cargo holds had to be sacrificed to achieve these changes. The combination of an upgrade from a drone forge to true flight decks and the systems to launch Footman drones mean that it can offer impressive fleet support for its size.",,,,
InReC_dominator,SHIP,[TODO],,,,
,,,,,,
InReC_flash_drone,SHIP,"A cheap and disposable interceptor drone, able to swarm and overwhelm most hostile fighter wings with a volley of Flash Bolter fire. Organised resistance proves to be a significant threat though, as they will rapidly fail under any amount of focused point-defense fire.",,,,
InReC_grinder_drone,SHIP,A basic drone platform mounting a Millstone cannon. While somewhat underwhelming in firepower it provides a cheap and consistent source of fire support.,,,,
InReC_flock_drone,SHIP,A basic drone platform mounting a Flock MRM. Contributes effectively to an overall strategem of missile saturation.,,,,

InReC_pulse,WEAPON,"A standard burst fire energy bolt weapon, mostly unremarkable but with the saving grace of an efficient flux profile.",,,,
InReC_pulse_hvy,WEAPON,"A heavier mount of a rather standard burst fire energy bolt weapon, mostly unremarkable but with the saving grace of an efficient flux profile.",,,,
InReC_flash_lt,WEAPON,Fires a burst of volatile energy bolts that scatter over a wide area.,,,,
InReC_flash,WEAPON,Fires a large burst of volatile energy bolts that scatter and saturate a wide area.,,,,
InReC_spark,WEAPON,"Burst fire missile defense weapon, with highly respectable range and projectile velocity.",,,,
InReC_spark_hvy,WEAPON,"An upsized burst fire missile defense weapon, a rapid cycle rate compensates for the somehat anemic low density energy bolts it fires.",,,,
InReC_fusion,WEAPON,Projects a ragged spread of high temprature energy bolts that are highly effective at wearing down armour.,,,,
InReC_gluon,WEAPON,"Fires a large burst of swarming energy bolts, offering somewhat inaccurate long range fire support at a flux premium.",,,,
InReC_disruption,WEAPON,A medium range ion weapon that delivers a temporary buildup of arcing disruptive energy that proves highly effective at disabling enemy systems and engines.,,,,
InReC_negatron,WEAPON,Delivers bursts of highly destructive charged energy bolts. While somewhat flux hungry it performs quite effectively against both shields and armour.,,,,
,,,,,,
InReC_bludgeon,WEAPON,"Fires heavyweight explosive shells that tear through armoured targets, also features an internal magazine allowing for short bursts of rapid fire.",,,,
InReC_millstone,WEAPON,"A simple and reliable two barreled cannon. While the mid-caliber fragmentation shells are somewhat lacking in damage output, the weapon has an easily manageable flux profile.",,,,
InReC_millstone_tri,WEAPON,"A simple and reliable three barreled cannon. While the mid-caliber fragmentation shells are somewhat lacking in damage output, the weapon has an easily manageable flux profile.",,,,
InReC_fusor,WEAPON,"Two light railguns fused into a single weapons system, efficient and consistent, but surpassed in raw firepower by various other weapons.",,,,
InReC_fusor_linked,WEAPON,"A pair of fused railguns, just like the smaller model remains efficient, but retains the comparative lack of damage output.",,,,
InReC_canister,WEAPON,"A snub barreled cannon that fires canisters of high-density flechettes, able to overwhelm shield projectors in an instant, but has a rather short effective range.",,,,
,,,,,,
InReC_flock,WEAPON,A basic lightweight missile. While lacking in speed and payload it has a respectable long-burn engine and integrates an autoloader allowing for sustained support fire.,,,,
InReC_flock_pod,WEAPON,A pod of basic lightweight missiles. While lacking in speed and payload it has a respectable long-burn engine and integrates an autoloader allowing for sustained support fire.,,,,
InReC_pesticide,WEAPON,"A launcher for cheap lightweight missiles, while lacking in payload the presence of an autoloader system means that they can be adequate at suppressing point defense if nothing else.",,,,
InReC_pesticide_pod,WEAPON,"A twin tube launcher for cheap lightweight missiles, while lacking in payload the presence of an autoloader system means that they can be adequate at suppressing point defense if nothing else.",,,,
InReC_fumigator,WEAPON,An armoured missile that is unusual in that rather than directly dealing damage it saturates hostile point defenses by launching a massed volume of flares.,,,,
InReC_defoliant,WEAPON,"An armoured chassis propelled by a powerful single-stage solid fuel engine. While the engine gives it the velocity to deal significant damage to shielding, maneuverability unfortunately suffers in exchange.",,,,
InReC_heart-throb,WEAPON,"A launch rail system for lightweight drones. While the drones are very fragile and rather lightly armed, they can pose a suprisingly significant threat to targets that lack adequate point defense.",,,,
InReC_beekeeper,WEAPON,A Blister micromissile carrier that deploys a barrage of munitions on nearing its target. This blisters submunitions are loaded with a kinetic payload making it effective against shielding but lackluster otherwise.,,,,
InReC_beekeeper_pod,WEAPON,A pod of Blister micromissile carriers that each deploy a barrage of munitions on nearing their target. These blisters submunitions are loaded with a kinetic payload making them effective against shielding but lackluster otherwise.,,,,
