InReC_brawler,SHIP,"Downgrading the flux core that makes the Brawler so potent might seem like a strange choice, but the volume of missile firepower that can be deployed by this modified variant more than makes up for the loss of direct fire capability.",,,,,
InReC_vigilance,SHIP,"Outfitting the Vigilance has often been seen as something of an awkward proposition, but this InReCo conversion aims to resolve that issue. Improved defenses and a cluster flak array mean that weapons can be dedicated solely to offense without running into concerns with how the craft can deal with missiles and fighters.",,,,,
InReC_centurion,SHIP,"The Centurion is a dependable frigate that is able to survive far more punishment than most other ships of its size and this InReCo conversion seeks to go beyond that. An upgraded flux core, superior weapon mounts and concussion pulse vanes mean that this ship can not only take damage, but dish it out as well.",,,,,
InReC_cerberus,SHIP,"An extensive refit of the Cerberus, a large portion of the storage space has been replaced with an autoforge and the attendant launch mechanisms that allow deployment of Lacayo drones. While no-longer able to offer any real logistical support this ship is now able to act as an effective drone support platform for smaller fleets.",,,,,
InReC_sunder,SHIP,"This InReCo conversion is a textboox example of their doctrine, while it retains a largely energy focused armament. The addition of a significant amount of missile firepower alongside the single ballistic mount shifts the nature of the immediate threat posed by the ship, but it remains largely unchanged in overall role, remaining something of a glass cannon.",,,,,
InReC_enforcer,SHIP,"Highly modified from the standard Enforcer hull, this ship can field a dizzying array of missiles, and when combined with a generous cluster flak array it can prove a solid anchor for smaller fleets. While in larger engagements it can act as a dependable and survivable support and escort craft.",,,,,
InReC_drover,SHIP,"InReCo converted this Drover to be able to be more capable as a front line combatant, improved defenses and flux systems mean that it can survive better than the standard Drover. Despite the upgrades this ship still remains inferior to a dedicated combat craft, and relies  more on the strategic advantage that it can offer with a mix of missiles, fighters and a Lacayo drone.",,,,,
InReC_champion,SHIP,"Only recently being pushed into production this conversion suprised many in how quickly it was developed by InReCo. The external weapons configuration has seen some notable changes, though internal modifications are suprisingly minor and nearly all of the core hulll framework remains untouched.",,,,,
InReC_venture,SHIP,"Converted to act as a carrier, this Venture modification is far more combat capable than the original craft, but some armour and a significant portion of the cargo holds had to be sacrificed to achieve these changes. The combination of the upgrade from a drone forge to true flight decks and the systems to launch Lacayo drones mean that it can offer impressive fleet support for its size.",,,,,
InReC_dominator,SHIP,"Despite an upgraded flux grid, this Dominator conversion can struggle to sustain the flux load of all of the many weapon mounts that it features, but nonetheless it is more than capable of acting as a solid defensive bulwark around which the rest of a fleet can operate.",,,,,
InReC_falcon,SHIP,"The addition of concussion pulse vanes linked to a high throughput energy focus system give a notable boost to the firepower of this InReCo conversion of the Falcon. Despite the added mass  from the wide range of modifications  that have been applied, improvements to the already impressive engines allow this ship to maintain the speed and mobility distinctive to the Falcon.",,,,,
InReC_conquest,SHIP,"All but completely turning the design prinicples of the Conquest on their head, this redesign sacrifices a large portion of its direct firepower in order to field a respectable carrier and drone complement.",,,,,
InReC_retribution,SHIP,"The removal of the ""Orion Drive"" system comes to the relief of crews, and while the reduction in explosive mobility leaves this converted Retribution less able to employ hyper-aggressive tactics, improved flux and defensive systems allow it to act as a more ""traditional"" battlecruiser quite effectively.",,,,,
InReC_pegasus,SHIP,"This retrofit of the Pegasus offers a significant improvement in defensive capabilities, but the overall reduction in mount sizes requires a careful consideration of  installed weaponry to prevent a loss in effective damage output.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
InReC_zumbido,SHIP,"Initially developed as a demonstration testbed platform for various advanced technologies, due to the success of the constituent technologies the Zumbido was further refined and ended up being finalised into its current form.",,,,,
InReC_trastorno,SHIP,"Following the success of the Zumbido a heavier vessel taking full advantage of the developed technologies was produced, the resulting combination of focused frontal firepower and superior mobility make the Trastorno a true hunter-killer.",,,,,
InReC_estrondo,SHIP,"Designed to exploit the full advantages of cutting-edge InReCo technology, which combined with a focus on frontal firepower allows the Estrondo to easily 'punch up' and deliver serious damage to exposed targets.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
InReC_flash_drone,SHIP,"A cheap and disposable interceptor drone, able to swarm and overwhelm most hostile fighter wings with a volley of Flash Bolter fire. Organised resistance proves to be a significant threat though, as they will rapidly fail under any amount of focused point-defense fire.",,,,,
InReC_grinder_drone,SHIP,A basic drone platform mounting a Millstone cannon. While somewhat underwhelming in firepower it provides a cheap and consistent source of fire support.,,,,,
InReC_flock_drone,SHIP,A basic drone platform mounting a Flock MRM. Contributes effectively to an overall strategem of missile saturation.,,,,,
InReC_espada,SHIP,"This design that was derived from the Broadsword, the Espada makes great sacrifices in anti-ship firepower in order to make an attempt at all but completely occupying the attention of hostile point defense gunners.",,,,,
InReC_javali,SHIP,"Heavyweight and heavily armed, the Javali carries a powerful general purpose punch in the form of a Quark Bolter. Despite its impressive firepower and durability the fact that there are only two craft in a wing can lead to it struggling against more well defended targets.",,,,,
InReC_empacho,SHIP,"Packed full of InReCo Concussion technology, while the damage output of the Empacho is rather low it offers effective support fire that can disrupt hostile combat performance.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
InReC_greg,SHIP,"An autonomous combat drone, outfitted with a Spark Bolter the standard Lacayo is largely useful as a distraction but can offer some point defense utility.",,,,,
InReC_greg_a,SHIP,"An autonomous combat drone, outfitted with a Fusion Bolter the assault Lacayo is able to tear through armour.",,,,,
InReC_greg_s,SHIP,"An autonomous combat drone, outfitted with a Gluon Bolter the support Lacayo is oriented for providing pressure onto its target, but lacks in killing potential.",,,,,
InReC_pulse_drone_g,SHIP,A simple drone that is little more than an engine and a Pulse Bolter.,,,,,
InReC_pulse_drone_w,SHIP,"A simple drone that is little more than an engine and a Pulse Bolter, this lightweight variant has had all but the most essential protection removed.",,,,,

InReC_negatron,WEAPON,Delivers bursts of highly destructive charged energy bolts. While somewhat flux hungry it performs quite effectively against both shields and armour.,,,,,
InReC_hadron,WEAPON,"Long ranged and respectably flux efficient, this weapon offers a modest amount of firepower best suited to ships keeping to a restricted flux budget.",,,,,
InReC_quark,WEAPON,"Fires bursts of high powered bolts that embed Quark Charges into their targets, the resonant nature of the charges means that it is best used en-masse or alongside other weapons that can deliver charges.

The resonant nature of Quark Charges leads to an inherent synergy across the various weapons that deliver and manipulate them, and mounting them in volume across a fleet can easily multiply their destructive potential.",,,,,
InReC_burst,WEAPON,"A low output pulse weapon, it sacrifices damage output in order to emphasise mount flexibility and ease of installation.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
InReC_hangnail,WEAPON,"High velocity explosive shells that embed a Quark Charge into the target, the internal magazine grants it the ability to deliver devastating bursts of damage that can tear through armoured targets.

The resonant nature of Quark Charges leads to an inherent synergy across the various weapons that deliver and manipulate them, and mounting them in volume across a fleet can easily multiply their destructive potential.",,,,,
